# EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES - Problem set: Tensorflow

![Keras](Screencast/keras-tensorflow-logo.jpg)

These problems relate to the Python package Tensorflow. We will again use the famous iris data set. Save your work as a single Jupyter notebook file in a GitHub repository. Include any required data files, a README, and a gitignore file in the repository.

### Use Tensorflow to create model
Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

### Split the data into training and testing
Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

### Train the model
Use the testing set to train your model.

###Test the model
Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.

# Requirements

## To rum, the code first is necessary take the following steeps:

### Install Anaconda

Anaconda is a freemium open source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for large-scale data processing, predictive analytics, and scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment.

[More Info...](https://www.anaconda.com/)

[Download and Install](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)

https://www.anaconda.com/download/

### OR

- Having the latest python version. https://www.python.org/downloads/


## Installation
You can find the installation documentation for the
[Jupyter platform, on ReadTheDocs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
The documentation for advanced usage of Jupyter notebook can be found
[here](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

For a local installation, make sure you have
[pip installed](https://pip.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installing/) and run:

### Install Git 

https://git-scm.com/downloads


### Create a new directory somewhere, and clone the project by running from cmd:
```
git clone https://github.com/alexpt2000gmit/4Year_Tensorflow.git
```

## Usage - Running Jupyter notebook

### Running in a local installation

At folder launch with:

    $ jupyter notebook

Enter a URL in the address bar of your browser,

```
